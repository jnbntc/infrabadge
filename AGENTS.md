# InfraBadge development instructions

- Work only in this repository, `jnbntc/infrabadge`. Confirm Git root and origin.
- Keep distrobox-stack dedicated to environment management; do not edit it here.
- Target Waveshare ESP32-S3-ePaper-1.54 V2 only, ESP-IDF v5.5.5 at the locked commit.
- Check docs/HARDWARE.md and docs/upstream.json before assigning any GPIO.
- Separate board HAL, device protocols, rendering and application orchestration.
- M0 has no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, gateway, MQTT, Prometheus or credentials.
- Never flash hardware automatically. No erase_flash, eFuse writes, Secure Boot
  or Flash Encryption changes. Factory backups stay private and outside Git/CI.
- Compile all three profiles using tools/build.sh all in the prepared container.
  Run tools/test.sh for hardware-free checks. Never report an unexecuted check as passed.
- Keep third-party notices and pin SDK/dependency versions. Avoid broad driver bundles.
- Physical success, battery calibration, sleep current and wakeup remain unverified
  until a human performs the documented checks on the actual board.
- Do not run git push, create a release or merge without user authorization.
